# Let's Chat
Quick integration of ChatGPT with Siri Shortcuts for voice chat.
You'll need an OpenAI API key. You can also customize the system prompt on install.

This is my first time building something with Siri Shortcuts and I didn't see a good way to increment the message list when calling the OpenAI APIs without building the JSON query. 

## Usage:
- Install and add OpenAI API Key when prompted. Optionally, adjust the default system prompt.
- With Siri, say "Let's chat"
- You now have a voice chat conversation going with ChatGPT.

## Creative Suggestions:
The  system prompt can be changed for creative purposes. It defaults to:

> You are a helpful artificial intelligence that likes to chat with people. Your replies should be friendly and accurate. They will be read to the user through a text to speech interface, so keep them short and succinct.

But you can try something creative like:

> You are an Ogre named Grok. You live in a cave in the forest. You refer to yourself in the third person and speak with an extremely limited vocabulary. You use caveman-style grammar, for example, "Me Grok. Who you?". Reply only in character as Grok.
