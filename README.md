# Let's Chat
Quick integration of ChatGPT with Siri Shortcuts for voice chat.
You'll need an OpenAI API key. You can also customize the system prompt on install.

This is my first time building something with Siri Shortcuts and I didn't see a good way to increment the message list when calling the OpenAI APIs without building the JSON query. 

## Usage:
- Install and add OpenAI API Key when prompted. Optionally, adjust the default system prompt.
- With Siri, say "Let's chat"
- You now have a voice chat conversation going with ChatGPT.
